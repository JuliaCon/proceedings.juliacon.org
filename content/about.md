# About {#about}
## Code of Conduct {#code_of_conduct}

Although spaces may feel informal at times, we want to remind authors and reviewers (and anyone else) that this is a professional space. As such,
the JuliaCon community adheres to a [code of conduct](https://juliacon.org/2019/coc). Furthermore the proceedings -- this includes the submission
and review process and interactions with and among reviewers and editors -- adhere to a code of conduct adapted from the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/)
and the [JOSS code of conduct](https://github.com/openjournals/joss/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

Authors, reviewers and editors will be required to confirm they have read out [code of conduct](/coc), and are expected to adhere to it in all
JuliaCon proceedings spaces and associated interactions.

## Ethics Guidelines {#ethics}

We also want to remind authors and reviewers (and anyone else) that we expect and require ethical behavior. Some examples are:

- All authors are obliged to provide retractions or corrections of any mistakes of which they become aware.
- Plagiarism (e.g., violation of another author's copyright), for both software and papers, is not allowed.
- Self-plagiarism (repeated publication of the same work) is not allowed.
- Author lists must be correct and complete. All listed authors must have made a contribution to the work, and all significant contributors should be included in the author list.
- Reviews should be accurate and non-fraudulent. Examples of concerns are: Authors should not suggest reviewers who are not real people or have conflicts. Reviewers and editors must disclose conflicts. Bribes for authors, reviewers, editors are not permitted.

Any potentially unethical behavior should be brought to the attention of the JuliaCon proceedings staff. See [Contact](#contact).
The JuliaCon Proceedings Editors will track any concerns and respond to the submitter with a resolution,
which will range from doing nothing if the editors disagree about the issue to withdrawing papers and notifying authors' institutions.
