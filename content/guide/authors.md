# Author's Guide

The JuliaCon is accepting two different kinds of submission,
a long form paper submission and a short form extended abstract.

## General guide

Proceedings are meant as a complement to a presentation of
any format (mini-symposium, talk, lightning talk, poster)
accepted for the conference. They provide readers with
references, detailed explanations and structure required to
understand the subject of the presentation in more depth.
All submissions are reviewed with the same process as
the [Journal of Open-Source Software](http://joss.theoj.org).
